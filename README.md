# bedwars-airship

## Folder Setup
1. Clone [Airship](https://github.com/easy-games/airship) into the same parent folder as this repo. That is, both "airship" and "bedwars-airship" should be siblings.

## Setting up the TypeScript Project
Note: you must open the project in Unity before building the Typescript.

Use Git Bash on PC, or Terminal on Mac:
First, `cd` into the TypeScript project directory.
```
cd Assets/Typescript~
```

Next, install node dependencies.
```
npm i
```

Now start the compiler in watch mode.
```
npm run watch
```

## Using ParrelSync for the Server
We use a tool called ParrelSync to create a clone of the project that runs as the server. You don't make changes to the clone, only the main project. Any changes you make in the main project is auto-synced to the clone. 

1. Select **ParrelSync > Clones Manager**

2. Click **Create New Clone**. This will generate a copy of the project that will act as our server. 
Once complete, set the arguments to "server"
